# LambdaBetterGrass Refabricated

An unofficial Fabric port of the [actual better grass and snow mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdabettergrass) by [LambdAurora](https://modrinth.com/user/LambdAurora) for 1.21.1, based on the work done by [IMS212](https://github.com/IMS212) for [Fabric 1.21](https://github.com/IMS212/LambdaBetterGrass).

From the original author:
> Have you ever used the MCPatcher/OptiFine better grass feature? I did, and I didn't like it at all. The main issue is that it's too rough even at Fancy settings. That's why I made my own mod to fix this issue and provide an alternative to one of the OptiFine features on the Fabric ecosystem! Grass blocks will now connect, and the nearby grass blocks will be smoothed.
